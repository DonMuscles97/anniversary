        <h1 class="heading1">Who Am I?</h1>
        <p class="text1">Not really sure how you could be on this website if you didn't know me but, i'm Don Muscles aka the Young Senpai. I'm the person who made this website, which for me is a pretty big accomplishment because this is legit the first website i've made. As far as things about me. Hmmmm Ok, not that it really matters but I just graduated with a bachelor's in computer and network from wilmington university. I'm a seeker of the truth, take that as you will. I like hanging with the boys, doing things with my gf JJ the person this website was literally designed for, and I dabble in video editing to a degree. I could literally go on all day about who I am and what i'm about as well as what i'm into but for now just know that I am a young budding web dev thats about to build the future.</p>

        <h1 class="heading2">What's the Website about?</h1>
        <p class="text1">Ok, dope so JJ if this is you reading this; this is the dope ass gift that everyone has been saying your going to love. Well everyone except Ashanna she said that it was kind of corny haha. Well anyway I made this website to show how special of a person you; and even though we argue and shit and don't agree on certain things I love you. You literally have no idea how hard it was to not tell you I was making this for you because this is the first real project i've coded and everytime I got stuck and then made a break through I would want to hit you up and be like hey look what I did but everytime I was about to i'd be like damn I can't so I hope that you love the website because I don't put effort into everything I do and it shows but I genuinely for the lack of a better term "put my heart into this".  </p>
