                    <p class="text">For this one I did from April 5-7 instead of individual days because this was one event it just took up 3 days. So for those of you who do not know this for Jalyn's birthday me, Jalyn, Ryan, and JJ's friend Asia went to New york which was uhhhh interesting to say the least. Well the first day we got there was pretty cool we pretty much got to the Air BnB (by the way as of typing this on september 3rd just realised that bnb probably stands for bed and breakfast) unpacked some of our stuff then i'm pretty sure we went out to a bar. The bar we went to was pretty beat honestly, so after getting there and paying the fee required for not having boobs I went and got a drink with my boy Rybud then we went over to the dance floor which was pretty dope for the most part. The music was kind of beat at first then I started making requests so it got pretty hype. After that pretty sure we went back to the AirBnB. The next day the car got towed which was a hassle in itself so we had to go get that, then later we drank a little, went out to the city again, and we hit some pretty lit bars one had a slide  and giant jenga and giant connect 4 which was tight. After that we went to another bar pretty sure then we went back to the air bnb then we left the next day. Was a pretty fun trip more so cause of the people who went; not what we did.</p>
