                    <p class="text">So JJ if you don't remember what we did for your birthday this is a recap of how your birthday went. So you had class and after class you went home and I routed over to you house and then me you and your mom and dad went out to get lunch at sushi xtreme, but you failed to tell them that sushi xtreeme didn't open until 4; and it was around 1 30 so we had to drive there and wait so while we were parked we went over to that weird place with sand that one store that looked like anabelle belonged on the shelf and rite aid. After it got to 2 we went in and while we were eating sushi your dad was saying how much he didn't like the food which had me bagging up lol. It was really clutch he paid the bill though because I was so expecting to pay. Hmmm what else happened oh yeah; after sushi we went to Marshalls and that was about it more or less. </p>
