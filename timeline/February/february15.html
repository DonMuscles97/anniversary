                    <p class="text">Yep, definitely can't forget this one. Pretty much what happened with this was me and Jalyn weren't able to do valentines day together because she had to work and I had class; so there was no way that we could have spent any time together. Since we couldn't spend any time together I was going to go to a club with Rybud and Joe, but when I told Jalyn she got mad upset so I didn't, so I show up to her house like 12am and wait outside until she gets off of work and gets home which was at like 1. It was pretty wild cause it was dummy cold outside plus her sister Skylar pulled up before her and was like why are you just waiting outside and I pretty much was just like yeah your sister was upset and im fixing it. But anyway Jalyn got home then we went out to dinner later that day and stuff was chilling for the most part.</p>
