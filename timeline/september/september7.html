                    <p class="text">Bruuuuuh; this day was literally the fucking geek (funny as hell). It was a Friday I'm going to skip what happened during the day cause honestly it doesn't matter; what matters is what happened that night. So let me set the stage. It's a Friday night around like 7 and me and Rybud (Ryan my roomate /A1 day one) were chilling on the couch. He was like yo you tryna go to Grottos with me and Joe (my other roomate the british one). I was like nah i got a date and he was like whaaat and I was like yeah and told him about Jalyn, and then as I was telling him about her she called and i put her on speaker phone and talked to her while i was on the couch (I can not confirm nor deny whether this girl knew she was on speaker) and then before I left Ryan was like bro you are going to hate her you guys literally have nothing in common. The date was at Friendlys and shes just sitting in her car as I pull up so I get out of the car looking fly as hell I have on a teal shirt and like black jeans and we go into Friendlys and when the waiter asks what we want to drink I tell her I want a diet water (got that one from my boy Diaire aka Dembel another of my A1 day ones). So to make a long story kind of short we sit in Friendlys for like 2 or 3 hours and then we leave and go outside and sit on her car for a bit see someone come vandalise one of the waiters cars and then we chill in my car and listen to music, at this point Ryan is asking me how much longer im going to be cause weve been at Friendlys for roughly 3 or 4 hours now and I tell him I don't know when I'm leaving. He says ok, and more time passes and Jalyns like whos texting you or something (or maybe I told her not sure). Anyway at some point some guy asks Joe for a piece of pizza cause apparenly Joe got some while he was there, and he was like you can lick my ass and the guy tackeled him or something but I told Jalyn and she was like you should go help your friend and I was like nah hes with Ryan hes good then we continue to listen to music and I lean over and kiss her. Then we listen to music and talk some more and around 2 am we leave friendlys and then she goes home and I go home.
