                    <p class="text">    Hmmm September 1, 2018. This is for the most part was an average day. Pretty sure it was a Saturday. I woke remembering the night before of how I had been getting into the shits with the boys the night before at Kates a bar on University of Delaware's campus. I forget specifically where my roomates were Ryan was more than likely at work cause he still was working at Lum's not really sure about Joe Cbrack or Chris. Any who I wish i could say this morning hit differently but it dead ass didn't haha. So anyway i'm laying in bed and I think i should probably find someone to do my hair because I had wanted to get dreads for the longest but didn't have the bread to do it. It was one of those times in your life where you make ok money but your bills leave you with nothing plus the fact you live in an apartment with 4 other heads and are still in college. With that said i came up with an amazing plan (well i thought so anyway). The plan was to go on Tinder and swipe right on every black girl to find one that would do my hair. So for the majority of the morning I essentially watched my hero academia (an anime) and swiped right. Then around 12 I look at all of the matches that i had and started hitting them up. There was one girl in particular I remember; her picture was of her in this white shirt and blue jeans and she was by water which made me think she was and outdoorsy type of person.I ended up saying something to her like "Talking to you just made my day 1000 times better". Then she replied and was like "wow really" and I remember saying "no but it did get a bit better". and she felt that was amusing to some effect because we kept talking and that is how i met Jalyn lol.</p>
