                    <p class="text">So I didn't initially go into the whole can you do my hair thing, I had to finesse it a bit if you know what i mean. So by this point me and Jalyn had been talking off and on pretty consistently the night before was the first night i had talked to her on the phone and we talked for a long ass time, and that went well for the most part. However during that call the question came up and alas Jalyn did not know how to do hair. So I was like damn that blows and I didn't really want a relationship at the time so I wasn't just going to lead the girl on so I didn't text her the next day. So my day was going by pretty normal like i went to work after work i got a haircut and thats when it took a turn, I can't really say it took a turn for the worse because it actually ended up pretty well tbh. But pretty much  I was on my way back to my apartment from getting a haircut and I get a text that says so I put up with your bull shit all last night and I couldn't even get a good morning text. I was driving so I only saw the message and not who it was from and then I saw that it was from Jalyn so I literally starting laughing mad hard. Then I text her back and we started talking some more.</p>
