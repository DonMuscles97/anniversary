                    <p class="text">Ok so yeah, this is a reeeeally big one for me, these are the dates that we went to Washington D.C. To go see Steve Aoki which was one of the most amazing things I ever experienced in my life. Well anyway heres what went down so earlier in the year Ryan told me there was going to be a Steve Aoki concert a day or 2 after my birthday so I had to go and me and JJ decided to make a whole trip out of it instead of just going for the concert. So pretty much during the days in DC we went around to different museums and got to ride these electric scooters called birds which was pretty cool. Ok boom fast forward to the concert so We pregame in the Hotel room which was pretty fun. the concert was supposed to start at 9pm. So around 8 we call the uber to come get us. When the uber gets to our hotel room hes like steves not going on until like 12 so id wait until later to go. I said ok and we get out of the uber anyway we pregame some more get to the concert around 12 JJ pushes us to the front and then we watch Deorro's set which was fire!!! Then immediately after Steve comes on and not gonna lie seeing Aoki popping up on stage as the bass drops on noble gas (one of his songs on the neon future 3 album) was probably one of the greatest moments of my life. But pause that wasn't even the sickest part. The most amazing part was when Steve Aoki went to throw his cakes (yes for those of you who do not know steve aoki cakes people) he only had ten and as he threw them I began to lose hope but when he got to cake 10 I was like this is my last chance to get caked so I proceeded to start wilding hella hard, and I got his attention because soon after he pointed at me and looked dead into the windows of soul and threw the final sheet cake at me completing my journey. I literally had been planning on getting caked since march like I told my boys I was going to this concert and getting caked and I wrote it on a piece of paper before I left the hotel. Anyway, Jalyn was also caught in the cross fire and lost her shoes and we almost got stranded 3 hours from our hotel with no shoes, and we missed the finale becasue of this. But all in all would I do the same things again? No would definielty have charged my phone. But was it totally worth it fuck ass yeah. But yeah glad this all happened honestly was one of the best moments in my life tbh.
