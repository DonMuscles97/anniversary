                    <p class="text">Again we have another killer day in the books; this was the date of my second graduation party. This one was really dope to cause the majority of squad was there and some of JJs friends were which was pretty rad, and yeah it was just a pretty lit day. The highlight of this day was when we did the toast. Mainly due to the fact that I wanted to pop the wine and spray it. Before the party even started I had one bottle of wine I accidently poppped and Ryan was there and was like yeah when you go to pop the other bottle later your going to mess up; and thats legit what happened but anyway I still chugged the bottle and I did some burnouts in my car and got some pretty lit gifts.</p>
