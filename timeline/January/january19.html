                    <p class="text">Many of you may not be aware but this but for my senior year of high school I had a dream to go to a fancy ass party where I had to get flied up and where there was an open bar and music and people dancing and what not. So to accomplish this I was planning on becoming friends with sorority girls so I could get an invite to their formal than I was informed by Cbrack (roomate whos still the boy whos crazy good at finance) Rybud, Kirstyn (Colins girl whos a bit woke) and Joe (British roomate whos pretty cool) that those type of things happen in movies not college formals. So I was forced to go back to the drawing board. In the meantime me and Jalyn are chilling and she casually goes hey my aunt is having a 50th party thats pretty fancy. I go word thats lit. Come to find out this party is what I was searching for the whole time, they had waiters walking around with meat and weird ass fancy snacks on sticks and shit and there was an open bar and not only that. Ya boy young muscles out here (thats me btw Don Muscles is my alias) got to meet Tone Stith aka the next chris brown whos chilled with Drake and was boys with Chris Brown. There was also dancing a fancy ice sculpture and food but yeah man that was the cinderella shit that I always wanted to do.</p>
