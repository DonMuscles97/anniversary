                    <p class="text">This one right here is definitely a big one in my book. On May 20, 2019 I gratuated from Wilmington University with my Bachelor's in Computer and Network Security. So pretty much it started with me going to your house in the morning. I used your steamer to press my shirt, anyway skip a couple of minor details and were now at the graduation hall; me you my mom and my pops started taking pics which was pretty rad and I tried to get my dad to buy me a wilmington university shot glass (which days later I found out in my room that he actually did and stuck them in my bag) and you bought me a wilmington university hoodie and these pretty dope wooden bead things. So after that I go back to where the graduates were I start taking snaps while we walk in and then we get to our seats. During the ceremony I text you to tell my dad i'm gonna send it and you tell me that he says don't do anything stupid and I text you back trust the process and then my dad actually texts me that the process could ruin my life (pretty much that whole conversation was my dad talking me out of doing a backflip on the stage which I was so gonna do) so I don't do the flip I just hit the clock (a dance) on stage then after we all went to dinner (we all as in me bird, rybud, my brother brent, my brother Branden, my parents and JJ and her parents). After that I think we went back to the apartment and then went to a bar or something anyway. It was a pretty lit day.</p>
