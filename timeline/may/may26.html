                    <p class="text">The beer olympics is what this day came to be known as. For those of you who do not know what the beer olympics are look it up. JK haha i'll tell you. The beer olympics was a series of drinking challenges strung together in tournament fashion. But back to the story things kind of fell apart before we even began. It took a while to get all of the teams together so by the time they were all together some had started boozing already. So to make a long story kind of short eventually the teams were assembled but our score system was kind of lacking as well as the reffing and our organized event devolved into pure mayhem which for the most part is usually what happens at squad events so it was fine, shortly after the games ended there was a storm so everyone went inside and it more or less turned into a kickback. There were people playing smash bros in the room, some were playing drinking games in the kitchen it was an all around vibe.
